		<h1 class="text-center">What is Acceptance Criteria</h1>
	<p>Acceptance Criteria are applied to <a href="user-story.html">User Stories</a> by the <a href="product-owner.html">Product Owner</a>.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Acceptance criteria need not constitute an exhaustive list; they should be sufficient to get the game moving forward.</li>
		<li>Acceptance criteria are temporal in nature. That is, they help the team validate the story based on the functionality the product owner had in mind at a distant time in the past.</li>
		<li>Because acceptance criteria are temporal artifacts, they add no intrinsic value to future deliveries.</li>
		<li>As the Sprints progress, acceptance criteria become refined through each story iteration to create a workable product.</li>
		<li>Acceptance criteria can never be complete, as they embody expectations that change over time.</li>
