<h1>Working with Scrum</h1>
<h2>Why Scrum?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Scrum avoids waste - you only produce what the customer will actually use.  Normally many features go unused.</li>
	<li>A lack of early testing and customer feedback means that you lose the opportunity to hear about the other features they really want.</li>
	<li>Don't try to plain detail those things that are a long way away.  You need to be clear about a feature before you can describe its details.</li>
	<li>Blindly carrying on with a plan and refusing to accept change is bad because you end up building the wrong product</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Scrum is a framework / a set of rules for working.  Other practices need to be worked into it (that are domain-specific) such as <a href="extreme-programming.html">Extreme Programming</a>.</li>
	<li>Scrum won't tell the <a href="product-owner.html">Product Owner</a> how to prioritise the <a href="product-backlog.html">Product Backlog</a>, only htat it needs to be prioritised.</li>
	<li>Work takes place in a<a href="sprint.html">Sprint</a> which works against a <a href="sprint-backlog.html">Sprint Backlog</a> (taken from the <a href="product-backlog.html">Product Backlog)</a> and seeks to deliver a <a href="sprint-goal.html">Sprint Goal</a></li>
	<li>Scrum is incremental - you add thin slices of end-to-end functionality.</li> 
	<li>Scrum is value-driven not plan-driven.  You should do first what delivers most value.</li>
	<li>Scrum is often associated with <a href="continuous-delivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="acceptance-criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a> are applied to specific <a href="tasks.html">Tasks</a></li>
	<li><a href="definition-of-done.html">Definition of Done</a> are generic criteria that are applies to all items.</li>
	<li>The <a href="product-backlog.html">Product Backlog</a> can contain both business and technical issues.</li>
	<li>Progress can be tracked on a <a href="burndown-chart.html">Burndown Chart</a></li>
</ol>
