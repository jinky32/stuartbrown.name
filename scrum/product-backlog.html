			<h1>Product Backlog</h1>
			<p>Items on the Product Backlog are derived from <a href="user-story.html">User Stories</a> and each item should be a step towards achieving the <a href="product-vision.html">Product Vision</a>.  Everything goes on the Product Backlog - there is not a separate bug backlog because this would make prioritisation more difficult.</p>
			<h2>The Product Backlog is:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>List of requirements - items with business desires from the customer which lead to product improvement.</li>
				<li>A means to reach the <a href="product-vision.html">Product Vision</a></li>
				<li>Items are ordered be development priority.</li>
				<li>It is an incomplete and dynamic list - it is in constant evolution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Product Backlog Items should state problems not solutions.  For example if building a cooking application and PBI should be "I need to know when to prepare each item" rather than "I need an audio reminder for each step."</p>
			<h2>The Product Backlog should be:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Ordered</li>
				<li>Estimable (it can be <a href="estimate.html">Estimated</a>)</li>
				<li>Emergent</li>
				<li>Gradually Refined.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Refining the Product Backlog</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Product Backlog needs regular attention and care</li>
				<li>Ongoing process and ensures the Product Backlog is ordered, estimable, emergent and gradually refined.</li>
				<li>Done collaboratively by the <a href="product-owner.html">Product Owner</a> and <a href="development-team.html">Development Team</a></li>
				<li>Every <a href="scrum-team.html">Scrum Team</a> has it's own process - little daily sessions, weekly sessions, grooming session.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Product Backlog Items must be ready (according to the <a href="definition-of-ready.html">Definition of Ready</a>) to be consumed by the <a href="development-team.html">Development Team</a> so that they can be added to the <a href="sprint-backlog.html">Sprint Backlog</a> if necessary.</p>
			<h2>Estimating Backlog Items</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Estimates help understand team <a href="velocity.html">Velocity</a></li>
				<li>Precise / precision is the level of confidence in the interval i.e. an estimate of 1-3 days is less precise than an estimate of one day but more precise than an estimate of 1-7 days</li>
				<li>Accuracy is how close you were with your estimate</li>
				<li>Through <a href="estimate.html">Estimating</a> the team creates its own baselines
				<ul>
					<li>For example you can take a small Product Backlog Item, or one that you understand well, and give it a number.  You can then use this as a guide to measure more complex items.</li>
					<li>try using <a href="fibonacci.html">Fibonacci</a> method for estimating timings.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If team members disagree radically on the estimated time for an item then take the highest time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>There are three Cs invovled in creating Product Backlog items;</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Card (on which the <a href="user-story.html">User Stories</a> are written</li>
			<li>Conversation with the <a href="development-team.html">Development Team</a> to tease out the details behind the <a href="user-story.html">User Stories</a></li>
			<li>Confirmation - Agree acceptance test criteria - the mothod of building and testing within the <a href="sprint.html">Sprint</a></li>
		</ol>
		<p><a href="epics.html">Epics</a> are required features (or features that might be required) for which details are not yet known.  As you learn more about an epic they are broken down into separate <a href="user-story.html">User Stories</a> and added to the Product Backlog by the <a href="product-owner.html">Product Owner</a> </p>
		<p>Epics live at the bottom of the Product Backlog until they are broken down into individual User Stories</p>
		<h2>From Backlog Items to Tasks</h2>
		<p><em>More relsearch needed on this</em></p>
		<p>Backlog items are broken down into <a href="tasks.html">Tasks</a>.  Members of the <a href="development-team.html">Development Team</a> might work together on Product Backlog Items but will ikely be assigned different <a href="tasks.html">Tasks</a> within the Product Backlog Item.</p>
