<ul>
	<li>Estimates help understand team <a href="velocity.html">Velocity</a></li>
	<li>Precise / precision is the level of confidence in the interval i.e. an estimate of 1-3 days is less precise than an estimate of one day but more precise than an estimate of 1-7 days</li>
	<li>Accuracy is how close you were with your estimate</li>
	<li>Through <a href="estimate.html">Estimating</a> the team creates its own baselines
		<ul>
			<li>For example you can take a small <a href="product-backlog.html">Product Backlog</a> Item, or one that you understand well, and give it a number.  You can then use this as a guide to measure more complex items.</li>
			<li>try using <a href="fibonacci.html">Fibonacci</a> method for estimating timings.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If team members disagree radically on the estimated time for an item then take the highest time.</li>
</ul>
