			<h1 class="text-center">User Stories</h1>
			<p>User Stories are normally written at a <a href="user-story-writing-workshop.php">Story Writing Workshop</a>.</p>
			<p>A User Story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or a customer of the system. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who</li>
				<li>What</li>
				<li>Why</li>
				<li>"As a *role* I would like/want/should *function* so that *value*."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The User Story card is not meant to be a complete feature description but is rather a two-way promise between the <a href="development-team.php">Development Team</a> and the <a href="product-owner.php">Product Owner</a></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Development Team members promise that they will talk to the Product Owner before beginning work on the User Story.  This is important because it frees the Product Owner from concerns that every last detail needs to be put on the User Story card</li>
				<li>The Product Owner promises to be available when the Development Team is ready to talk.  This is important because it allows the Development Team to consider the User Story in <a href="sprint-planning.php">Sprint Planning</a>knowing that the Product Owner can provide more details as required to enable accurate <a href="estimate.php">Estimation</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>User Stories should be INVEST:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Independant (from other stories)</li>
				<li>Negotiable (details are negotiated)</li>
				<li>Valuable (to the customer)</li>
				<li>Estimable (by the <a href="development-team.php">Development Team</a>)</li>
				<li>Small (in implementation effort</li>
				<li>Testable (to allow for confirmation)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <a href="product-owner.php">Product Owner</a> should also provide <a href="acceptance-criteria.php">Acceptance Criteria</a> for each User Story.</p>
