<h1>User Stories</h1>
<p>User Stories are normally written at a <a href="user-story-writing-workshop.html">Story Writing Workshop</a>.</p>
	<p>A User Story is a representation of a feature:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Who</li>
		<li>What</li>
		<li>Why</li>
		<li>"As a *role* I would like/want/should *function* so that *value*."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>User Stories should be INVEST:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Independant (from other stories)</li>
		<li>Negotiable (details are negotiated)</li>
		<li>Valuable (to the customer)</li>
		<li>Estimable (by the <a href="development-team.html">Development Team</a>)</li>
		<li>Small (in implementation effort</li>
		<li>Testable (to allow for confirmation)</li>
	</ul>
